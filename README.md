🌦 Weather App

This is a simple Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⚠️ Important Note

Right now, this project does not use a live weather API.

Instead of fetching real-time weather data, the app uses a simulateWeatherData() function that generates random but realistic values (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.).

This was done because using the real OpenWeatherMap API requires an API key and may cause CORS (browser security) issues if not set up properly.

🔮 What this means

You will still see weather details (temperature, humidity, wind, icons).

But the values are not actual live weather — they are randomly generated for demo purposes.

🚀 Next Steps

If you want real weather data:

Get a free API key from OpenWeatherMap
.

Replace the simulateWeatherData() function with a real API call using fetch.

Then the app will show real-time weather for any city you search.
